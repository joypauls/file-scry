4. Confirm

### Basic Usage

### Compatibility

Currently supported (i.e. confirmed by testing... probably will still work on many others!) operating systems:
- macOS (tested on Big Sur)
- Several Linux flavors

Keep in mind this will also depend on which [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators) you are using. If you see problems running this on your OS/terminal, [let us know](#support-and-bugs).

### Customization

Using the `.scry.yaml` file

## Developers

This app is a just a regular old Go program so if you're set up to develop Go on your system you can easily compile it yourself.

### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/joypauls/scry.git`

2. Build the project `make build`
    - By default, it will compile to `<repo>/bin/scry`

3. Check that it worked with `<repo>/bin/scry -v`

## Support and Bugs

A bug? In my code?!? Unlikely!
